# Pironman 5 Dashboard (Grafana)

A more visual, fancy, and resource-efficient dashboard in Grafana, an alternative to the [pm_dashboard](https://github.com/sunfounder/pm_dashboard) application that displays sensor data generated by [Pironman 5](https://github.com/sunfounder/pironman5) in influxdb.

You can uninstall pm_dashboard and use this Grafana dashboard, especially if pm_dashboard is malfunctioning after a while, failing to display sensor data, and giving errors like below.

**pm_dashboard issues/errors:**
* [Pironman 5 Dashboard empty](https://forum.sunfounder.com/t/pironman-5-dashboard-empty/1218/51)
* [WARNING] Too many nulls in the result of the query: SELECT * FROM history ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 20, trying again...
* [Request to /api/v1.0/get-data and fails with error 404 Not found](https://github.com/sunfounder/pm_dashboard/issues/1)
* The server responded with a status of 404 (NOT FOUND) :34001/api/v1.0/get-data

## Recommendation : Create Credentials for influx
  
```
influx
> CREATE USER "pironman" WITH PASSWORD 'pironman-your-strong-password' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> exit
```

Please create a user and password for the influxdb and use this credentials at Grafana influx connection.
